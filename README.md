# 🧠 ML Learning Journey — Balaji Visvanathan

Welcome to my Machine Learning learning journey!  
This repository documents my step-by-step path to mastering ML — from data cleaning to deep learning — through 8 structured weeks of coding, math, and projects.

---

## 🎯 Goal
To build a solid foundation in Machine Learning — understanding not just *how to use models*, but *how they work*, backed by strong mathematical intuition.  
I’m an ECE student exploring multiple domains (ML, IoT, Quant, DSA), aiming to become a **jack of all trades — and a master of a few**.
